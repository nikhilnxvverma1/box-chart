# Box Chart
Box Chart is a software digaramming tool that uses type inference to semantically help in creating useful design diagrams.

### Status 
The project is currently in early development. If you are interested, please star(and watch) this project and check back soon. Thanks

### Instructions for running

1. Make sure you have node installed (check with node -v)
2. __npm install__
3. __npm start__ (or alternatively, if gulp is installed globally : _gulp run:server_ and _gulp run:client_ in 2 separate terminal windows)
4. The very first run may lead to some errors (because of fresh typescript transpiling).
 Thats okay, running second time onwards will work fine.
